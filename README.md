# GitHub Workflow Dev Tools
More instruction: [GitHub Workflow(Actions)开发环境](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/691842634)
Note: For AWS related content, assume you have already setup AWS credentials locally.

## Run local workflow using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act)
### Init
```
brew install act colima docker
colima start
```

### Sample commands
```shell
# act [Document]((https://nektosact.com/usage/index.html#events)) says the default event is `push`, but if there is only one event in workflow, act can still detect and trigger.
# Dispatch
act workflow_dispatch -W ./.github/workflows/test.yml
act -W ./.github/workflows/test.yml # Same as above
# Dispatch & specific job only
act -W ./.github/workflows/test.yml -j show_inputs
# Dispatch with payload. You can change "ref" in payload to call workflow on specific branch
act -W ./.github/workflows/dispatch.yml -e event.json
# Pull Request
act -W ./.github/workflows/pull-request.yml -e event_pr.json
# AWS S3 access, needs custom docker image
act -P ubuntu-latest=ubuntu-aws --pull=false -W ./.github/workflows/test-aws-s3.yml
```

### Customized docker image: AWS S3
Prepare `.secrets` locally
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXX
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXX
```

Using AWS CLI with the default medium docker image from act, you will get Error: aws command not found, because the image doesn't include AWS CLI.
We can build our own image locally based on their image and add AWS CLI.

Prepare the Dockerfile, and run:
```shell
docker build -t ubuntu-aws .
```
Then try:
```
act -P ubuntu-latest=ubuntu-aws --pull=false -W ./.github/workflows/test-aws-s3.yml
```

### Install private npm packages
`act` accept `.env` file to get environment variables. So you can create one like `.env.local` and fill in your NPM token.
```.env.local
NPM_TOKEN=your-npm-token
```

## Trigger workflow using [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
### Init
```
brew install gh
```

### Sample commands
```shell
# GitHub CLI
gh workflow list
gh workflow run dispatch.yml
echo '{"name": "Wayne"}' | gh workflow run dispatch.yml --ref 'master' --json
```

## FAQ
1. 执行act时, 如果之前安装过 Docker Desktop, 会遇到一个Docker的报错. 把`~/.docker/config.json`里的`"credsStore": "desktop"`去掉即可.
